# Plant-Diseases-Prediction-Model
This project is an image recognition system that detects plant leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies images into categories based on the presence of diseases, aiming to help farmers and agricultural professionals identify diseases early for timely intervention, reducing crop loss.
